# ponieproxy
Simple proxy which captures all requests and responses and saves them in uniquely named files.
It uses [goproxy](https://github.com/elazarl/goproxy).

It's useful for saving the traffic as text files and using it to find various data (like secrets, urls, endpoints), with the help of other bash tools.
It can also be used to apply the [HUNT Methodology](https://github.com/bugcrowd/HUNT) in a more bash friendly way.

## Install certificate
Add `ca.crt`, located in the root of this repository, as a trusted certificate either in you browser or in your system, in order to be able to intercept TLS traffic.

## Configure browser
First of all, in order to use ponieproxy, you should set your browser to use ponieproxy as an HTTP proxy.

## Install
If you don't plan to write your own filters, you can just download it and run it like a normal tool.

Since it's written in Go and you can install it using:

```
go get -u github.com/ctoyan/ponieproxy/cmd/ponieproxy
```

Or you can [download a binary](https://github.com/ctoyan/ponieproxy/releases).

## Basic Usage

### With default filters
Create a `inscope.txt` file with regex for scoped URLs and run the proxy:

`ponieproxy -u URLS_FILE -o OUTPUT_DIR`

`Note:` The default filters add the regex lines between parens. For example - `(REGEX_ON_LINE_ONE)|(REGEX_ON_LINE_TWO)`

### With custom filters
Clone/Fork this repository. [Write your filters](filters/README.md). Then `cd` into the cloned repo in `cmd/ponieproxy` and run:

```
go install
ponieproxy -o OUTPUT_DIR -u URLS_FILE
```
